<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Alone with her heart and the heavens above,</p><p>The silent stars looked on her young, sinless face,</p><p>Too full of faithâ€™s pathos, with pity and love.</p><p>For, far to the westward the winds were at war,</p><p>And soon sudden darkness spread over the world,</p><p>The waves were abroad with a hoarse, sullen roar</p><p>And nearer and colder they eddied and curled.</p><p>The moon and the stars with their stillness were gone,</p><p>Red meteors darted anon through the dark,</p><p>And fate seemed to hurry the hurricane on</p><p>Where rocked on the billows a rudderless bark.</p><p>When Neptune, near morning, the billows had bound</p><p>And stars hung in heaven like spangles of gold,</p><p>Deep down in the regions of silence profound</p><p>A form, faintly human, lay lifeless and cold.</p><p>But where, oh ye winds, is the maniac-maiden?</p></div> </div>
