<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter XXIII</h4><h3>A Legend Of The First Flood</h3><p class="  start-chapter">The story of the big flood is common to all the tribes around Puget Sound. The mountain referred to is usually the loftiest mountain nearest them. The Lummi Indians refer to Mt. Baker, the upper Stillaguamish to Mt. Pilchuck and the Nisquallies to Mt. Rainier, and each of them call their mountain Ta-ho-ma, from which is derived the name Tacoma. Ta-ho-ma means a lofty mountain, but does not refer to any peak in particular.</p></div> </div>
