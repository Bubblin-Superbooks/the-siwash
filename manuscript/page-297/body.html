There were graves pointed out which were made earlier than their tradition records and once graceful canoes of cedar placed above their dead owners are now crumbling into unshapely forms.</p><p>Marriage is a simple institution of “take a wife and live with her.”</p><p>The potlatch dance, or gift feast, is the year’s social event at Quinaiult.</p><p>Upon the acquirement of wealth the fortunate man issues a manifest to his  own and other tribes that it is his intention to hold a potlatch merriment. He gives up his entire fortune, for he acquires thereafter the title of “tyee” or chief. Presents of all values are lavishly distributed to those who attend. It is a grotesque ceremony and lasts many days.</p></div> </div>
