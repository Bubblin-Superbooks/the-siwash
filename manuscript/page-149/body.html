There are daubs of blue paint all about the mouth and chin and a small streak of blue around the neck. There is a circle on the breast cut with a knife and radiating from the two upper arcs are small three-pronged notches cut in by the same process much resembling a birdâ€™s claw and intended to represent the superstition of the great white eagle, from which, and a great whale, the Indians there are said to have sprung.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
